            <h2>Here's a time line of his Life...</h2>
            <p>APJ Abdul Kalam, aka the “Missile Man of India,” was one of those rare legends who managed to be both a hardcore scientist and a people’s president. Born in 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a super humble background—like, selling newspapers as a kid to support his family humble. But instead of letting that define him, he basically launched himself (pun intended 🚀) into the world of science.

             He worked with ISRO and DRDO, where he was a key brain behind India’s satellite launch vehicle programs and ballistic missile projects. That’s why the name “Missile Man” stuck. He wasn’t just building rockets—he was building India’s confidence on the global stage.

             In 2002, he became the 11th President of India, and honestly, he redefined what that role meant. He wasn’t your usual politician; he was “The People’s President.” Kids loved him, students idolized him, and even the so-called serious leaders couldn’t help but respect him. His speeches were always about dreaming big, innovating, and never letting failures stop you.

             He was also an author and philosopher at heart, with books like Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds that basically became starter packs for anyone chasing big dreams. The coolest part? He kept working with students, teaching, and giving lectures right till his last day in 2015—literally collapsing while delivering a talk. That’s how dedicated he was.

            In short: Abdul Kalam wasn’t just a scientist or a president—he was an inspiration machine. Proof that no matter where you start, if you mix curiosity, hard work, and humility, you can touch the sky.</p>
